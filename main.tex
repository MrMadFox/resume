\begin{rSection}{ WORK EXPERIENCE }

\begin{rSubsection}{ SDE: HYPERVERGE, Bangalore} {June 20 - Present}{}
    
    \item Worked on latest technologies - nodejs, python, docker, redis.
    \item Improved overall throughput by 60\% by splitting product into microservices.
    \item Developed polling models for s3 instead of committing to git, this has reduced effort of engineering team significantly.
    \item Developed an end to end service from scratch to blacklist devices, which has been integrated to the main product.
    \item Contributed and gained expertise in developing various components of document verification service, which analyzes and retrieves data. Built it from initial stages from defining the requirements to completion of deployment.
    \item Designed and developed end-to-end fully functional service which categorizes ID cards based on their quality into different buckets. Focused on various service aspects like scale and configurable design.
    
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{ Internship: HYPERVERGE, Bangalore} {Dec 19 - June 20}{}
    
    \item Implemented an API to avoid data theft, by encrypting customer data to transfer them through various geographies, which is decrypted on the receiver's side
    \item Developed a complete feature to mask user identification number, in national cards of various geographies. This has been made regional agnostic which generically solves the problem.
    \item Dockerised application which made deployment easy.
    \item Built an API which validates the user inputs with the data from the user uploaded ID card, this has been generalized to handle different kinds of information in the ID card. This helps customers avoid entering incorrect data.
    
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{ Internship: In-Plant Trainee, Ordnance Factory}{June 2018}{}

    \item Underwent a 4 week fully sponsored In-Plant Training Program.
    \item Designed model part using Solidworks.
    \item Gained experience working with CNC machines programmed using G-Code.

\end{rSubsection}

\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Projects}

\begin{rSubsection}{ Games Developed}{}{}

\item Created Snake, Pong, Bomber Man, Minesweeper games using Pygame(Python).
\item Created endless-run game using unity in C-sharp.
\item Coded multiplayer Shooting Game using UDP socket connection.
\item  \url{https://github.com/MrMadFox}.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{ Timing Attacks On RSA}{}{}

\item Analyzed how effective timing attacks can crack the key of RSA secured system.
\item The analysis performed highlights the vulnerabilities of the RSA algorithm.

\end{rSubsection}


\begin{rSubsection}{ Automatically Calling An Ambulance Service}{}{}

\item Created a service which calls an ambulance in the event of an accident. Used Raspberry Pi, which retrieves the coordinates of the vehicle location and passes it to the server.
\item Google Place API is used to retrieve the phone numbers of the ambulance services near to the accident location.
\item Used SMS-Gatewayhub to message the coordinates of the accident location to the ambulance service providers, thereby bypassing the need for a phone call.

\end{rSubsection}


\begin{rSubsection}{ Hosted A Site - Checkmeter}{}{}

\item Hosted a site using Flask. A custom link will be generated per user after signing up on this website. This link can be further forwarded to friends, in which they can enter data which is thereafter visible to the user.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{ Student Attendance Management System}{}{}

    \item Backend: Node.js.
    \item Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript.
    \item Created a website to manage attendence of students and perform operations.
